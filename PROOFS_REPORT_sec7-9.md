# Proofs Report for Sections 7--9

## Section 7: Finite fields
- Theorem: existence and uniqueness of $\mathbb{F}_q$.
- Theorem: $\mathbb{F}_q^\times$ is cyclic.
- Proposition: Frobenius automorphism and fixed field.
- Theorem: Galois group and subfields of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}/\mathbb{F}_p$.
- Proposition: minimal polynomial from Frobenius orbit.

## Section 8: Cyclotomic fields and Kummer theory
- Theorem: properties of cyclotomic polynomials.
- Theorem: $\Gal(\Q(\zeta_n)/\Q) \cong (\Z/n\Z)^\times$.
- Theorem (Kummer): correspondence for cyclic degree-$n$ extensions.

## Section 9: Solvability by radicals
All theorem-like statements already had proofs; none were added or missing.

No statements were skipped due to missing environments.
