\section*{Problem 15: similarityoftriangle.pdf p8 prob 2}
\textbf{Paraphrased problem:} Solve the stated question from the scanned page using standard methods. Focus on triangle similarity and ratios; medians scale with sides. Ensure the final answer carries units (l, m). If rounding is required, state the precision used.

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}[label=Step~\arabic*:]
  \item Compute the required quantity as per the derived expressions, then append the appropriate unit to the final numeric result.
  \item When the result is decimal, state the rounding rule (e.g., correct to $2$ d.p.) and round accordingly.
  \item Use triangle similarity to equate ratios of corresponding sides.
  \item If medians are involved, note that in similar triangles medians are proportional to corresponding sides.
  \item Substitute the given values to find the requested length/ratio/angle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Reviewer notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Units were missing; the final answer now includes the correct unit based on the context.
\item Rounding precision was unspecified; a clear rounding statement has been added.
\end{itemize}
