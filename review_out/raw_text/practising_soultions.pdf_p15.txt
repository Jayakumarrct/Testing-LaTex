 Question 17

 Question: In triangle ABC, medians BD and CE meet at centroid G. Prove (i) △EGD ∼ △CGB; (ii)
 BG = 2 GD.
 Solution Given: D is midpoint of AC, E is midpoint of AB; Medians BD and CE intersect at G.
 To Prove: (i) △EGD ∼ △CGB; (ii) BG = 2 GD.


                                            A



                                      E                    D
                                                   G


                                  B                                    C


 Step 1: In △ABC, E and D are midpoints of AB and AC respectively.

 Step 2: By the Midpoint Theorem, ED ∥ BC and ED = 12 BC.                              (midpoint theorem)

 Step 3: Part (i): Consider △EGD and △CGB.

 Step 4: Since ED ∥ BC, we have ∠GED = ∠GCB and ∠GDE = ∠GBC.                    (alternate interior angles)

 Step 5: Also, ∠EGD = ∠CGB.                                                    (vertically opposite angles)

 Step 6: Therefore, △EGD ∼ △CGB.                                                         (AAA similarity)

 Step 7: Part (ii): From the similarity, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.
           EG   GD   ED
 Step 8:      =    =    .
           CG   GB   CB
 Step 9: Using the ratio involving the sides we need and the one we know from the midpoint theorem:
         GD     ED
             =      .
         GB     CB
                                       1
                                  GD     BC  1
Step 10: Substitute ED = 12 BC:      = 2    = .                                              (substitution)
                                  GB   BC    2
                GD  1
Step 11: From      = , we cross-multiply to get BG = 2 GD.                                       (algebra)
                GB  2

 Answer: (i) The triangles are similar. (ii) BG = 2 GD is proved.
