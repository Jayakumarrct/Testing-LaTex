Step 1: For the triangles to be similar by SAS, the sides including the equal angles must be proportional.

Step 2: The sides including ∠B are AB and BC. The sides including ∠E are DE and EF.
                                 AB   BC
Step 3: Set up the proportion:      =    .                                    (SAS similarity condition)
                                 DE   EF
                                        7.5    9
Step 4: Substitute the given values:        =    .                                          (substitution)
                                       x+3    12
                               9  3
Step 5: Simplify the ratio:      = .
                              12  4
                               7.5  3
Step 6: Solve the equation         = .
                              x+3   4
Step 7: Cross-multiply: 7.5 × 4 = 3 × (x + 3).                                                  (algebra)

Step 8: 30 = 3x + 9 =⇒ 3x = 21 =⇒ x = 7.
                                                                                AC  6 3
Step 9: Consistency Check: Let’s check the ratio of the third sides, AC and DF.    = = . Since
                                                                                DF  8 4
        this ratio is the same, the triangles are indeed similar by SSS.

Answer: x = 7.




Question 4

Question: In the given figure, BC —— DE. Find the lengths of the sides of both the triangles. Sides are
given as expressions in x. △ADE: AD=18, AE=6x, DE=3(x+1). △ABC: AB=2x+1, AC=4x, BC=?.
Solution Given: A is the top vertex, DE is a horizontal line below BC, and BC ∥ DE. Side lengths in
terms of x.
To Prove: Find the value of x and the lengths of all sides.


                                                     A




                                           B                    C


                                       D                            E


Step 1: Since BC ∥ DE, by the property of similar triangles, △ABC ∼ △ADE.                (AA similarity)
                                                             AB   AC   BC
Step 2: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal:         =    =    .
                                                             AD   AE   DE
                                             2x + 1   4x
Step 3: Substitute the given expressions:           =    .
                                               18     6x
                                                                                  4x  4 2
Step 4: From the second part of the ratio, we can find the similarity constant:      = = .
                                                                                  6x  6 3
                                             2x + 1  2
Step 5: Now use this ratio to solve for x:          = .
                                               18    3
Step 6: Cross-multiply: 3(2x + 1) = 18 × 2.                                                     (algebra)
