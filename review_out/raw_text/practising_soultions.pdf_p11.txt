Step 5: (v) True. An isosceles right triangle must have angles 90-45-45. Any two such triangles are similar
        by AAA similarity.

Step 6: (vi) True. In a trapezium ABCD with AB ∥ DC, the diagonals intersect at O, forming △AOB and
                                                                                            AO   BO
        △COD. These triangles are similar (AA similarity), so their sides are proportional: CO = DO .

Answer: (i) False, (ii) True, (iii) True, (iv) False, (v) True, (vi) True.




Question 12

Question: D is a point on the side BC of triangle ABC such that ∠ADC = ∠BAC. Prove that
CA2 = CB · CD.
Solution Given: In △ABC, D is on BC such that ∠ADC = ∠BAC.
To Prove: AC 2 = CB · CD.


                                              A
                                               α




                                                           α
                                    B                     D           C


Step 1: Consider △ADC and △BAC.

Step 2: ∠ADC = ∠BAC.                                                                               (given)

Step 3: ∠ACD = ∠BCA (or ∠C).                                                              (common angle)

Step 4: Therefore, △ADC ∼ △BAC.                                                           (AA similarity)

Step 5: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal. Match vertices: A ↔ B, D ↔ A, C ↔ C.
              AC   DC   AD
Step 6: So,      =    =    .                                                         (corresponding sides)
              BC   AC   BA
                                                      AC   DC
Step 7: From the first two parts of the proportion,      =    .
                                                      BC   AC
Step 8: Cross-multiply to get AC × AC = BC × DC, which is AC 2 = CB · CD.                        (algebra)

Answer: AC 2 = CB · CD.
