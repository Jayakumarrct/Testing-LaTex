To Prove: △ABC ∼ △DEF (SAS).


                                C
                                                                  F




                                            B
                                                                            E
                       A                                  D


Step 1: Identify the included angle and sides: in △ABC, sides AB, AC include ∠A; in △DEF , sides
        DE, DF include ∠D.                                            (definition of included angle)
                                    AB   AC
Step 2: Use the data ∠A = ∠D and       =    .                                                 (given)
                                    DE   DF
Step 3: Conclude △ABC ∼ △DEF .                                                       (SAS similarity)

Answer: △ABC ∼ △DEF by SAS.




Question 3

Question: In △ABC and △DEF , ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E and ∠C = ∠F . Also, AL and DM are medians.
Prove that BC   AL
           EF = DM .

Solution Given: △ABC ∼ △DEF (AAA), and AL, DM are medians.
          BC     AL
To Prove:     =     .
          EF    DM


              B                                      E
                                L                C                    M              F



                           A                                        D

                                    BC   AB   AC
Step 1: From △ABC ∼ △DEF , get         =    =    .                                 (similar triangles)
                                    EF   DE   DF
Step 2: Since L and M are midpoints, BL = 12 BC and EM = 21 EF .                (definition of median)
                    BL   BC
Step 3: Therefore      =    .                                                    (divide equal halves)
                    EM   EF
                                                         AB   BL
Step 4: In △ABL and △DEM , we have ∠B = ∠E and              =    . (correspondence from similarity)
                                                         DE   EM
