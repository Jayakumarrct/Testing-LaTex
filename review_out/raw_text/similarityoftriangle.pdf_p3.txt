Core Definitions and Similarity Criteria
   Definition
   Similar triangles: △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐴′ 𝐵′ 𝐶 ′ if ∠ 𝐴 = ∠ 𝐴′ , ∠𝐵 = ∠𝐵′ , ∠𝐶 = ∠𝐶 ′ (AAA), or if certain
   side-angle conditions hold (SAS, SSS).

   Warning

   Common mistakes
    • Using a non-included angle for SAS.
    • Mismatching corresponding sides when writing ratios.
    • Forgetting that areas scale by 𝑘 2 , not by 𝑘.
