Question 4

Question: In △ABC, AD is perpendicular to side BC and AD2 = BD × CD. Prove that ∠BAC = 90◦ .
Solution Given: AD ⊥ BC and AD2 = BD · CD.
To Prove: ∠BAC = 90◦ .


                                            A




                                B           D               C

Step 1: In △ADB, AB 2 = AD2 + BD2 .                                 (Pythagoras in right △ADB)
Step 2: In △ADC, AC 2 = AD2 + CD2 .                                 (Pythagoras in right △ADC)
Step 3: Add: AB 2 + AC 2 = 2AD2 + BD2 + CD2 .                                     (add equations)

Step 4: Substitute AD2 = BD · CD to get AB 2 + AC 2 = (BD + CD)2 = BC 2 .              (given and
       BC = BD + CD)
Step 5: Conclude ∠BAC = 90◦ .                                            (converse of Pythagoras)

Answer: ∠BAC = 90◦ .
