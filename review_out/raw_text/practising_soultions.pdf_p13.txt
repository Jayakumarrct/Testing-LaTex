 Step 1: Find PN: Consider △N P L and △RQL.

 Step 2: Since PS ∥ QR, then PN ∥ QR.

 Step 3: ∠P N L = ∠RQL and ∠N P L = ∠QRL.                                     (alternate interior angles)

 Step 4: ∠N LP = ∠RLQ.                                                              (vertically opposite)

 Step 5: Therefore, △N P L ∼ △RQL.                                                     (AAA similarity)

 Step 9: Find RM: Consider △M RL and △P QL.

Step 10: Since RS ∥ PQ.

Step 11: ∠RM L = ∠P QL and ∠M RL = ∠QP L.                                     (alternate interior angles)

Step 12: Therefore, △M RL ∼ △P QL.                                                      (AA similarity)
                                 RM   RL
Step 13: The ratio of sides is      =    .

           RM    2        2       32
Step 14:       =   =⇒ RM = × 16 =    cm.

                                   32
 Answer: P N = 15 cm, RM =            cm.

 Question 15

 Question: In the figure, AB ∥ EF ∥ DC in trapezium ABCD. Given AB = 67.5 cm, DC = 40.5 cm
 and AE = 52.5 cm, with E on AD and F on BC. Find the lengths of EC and EF . Note: The statement
 appears incomplete. Without how E divides AD (i.e., AE : ED or AD), EC and EF are not uniquely
 determined. Below is the standard relationship when a line segment EF is drawn parallel to the bases in
 a trapezium.
 Solution Given: Trapezium ADCB with AB ∥ EF ∥ DC. AB=67.5, DC=40.5, AE=52.5. E is on AD.
 To Prove: Find ED and EF. (Assuming EC was a typo for ED).
