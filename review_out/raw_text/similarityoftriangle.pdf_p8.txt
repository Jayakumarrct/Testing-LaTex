   Steps
                                   𝐵𝐷   𝐴𝐵 7
   1. Angle Bisector Theorem:         =   = .

                                                           12 3
   2. Let 𝐵𝐷 = 7𝑥, 𝐷𝐶 = 9𝑥, then 7𝑥 + 9𝑥 = 12 ⇒ 𝑥 =          = .

   3. 𝐵𝐷 = 7𝑥 = 5.25, 𝐷𝐶 = 9𝑥 = 6.75.

      Shortcut
      Split in the ratio of the adjacent sides.


   Example

   Type D: Parallel line cuts triangle
   In △𝐴𝐵𝐶, 𝐷𝐸 ∥ 𝐵𝐶 with 𝐴𝐷 = 5, 𝐷𝐵 = 7, 𝐴𝐸 = 6. Find 𝐸𝐶.

                                                  𝐷
                               𝐴


   Steps
            𝐴𝐷    𝐴𝐸      5    6
   1. BPT:     =      , so =     .
           𝐷𝐵 𝐸𝐶          7 𝐸𝐶
   2. Cross-multiply: 5 𝐸𝐶 = 42 ⇒ 𝐸𝐶 = 8.4.

      Shortcut
      Set up the proportion once; check order carefully.


   Example

   Type E: Shadow / scale-model problem
   At the same time, a tree casts a 9 m shadow and a 1.5 m stick casts a 1.2 m shadow. How tall is the
   tree?
