Consequences of Similarity
   Property

   If △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐴′ 𝐵′ 𝐶 ′ with scale factor 𝑘 (so 𝐴′ 𝐵′ = 𝑘 𝐴𝐵), then:
    • Corresponding angles are equal.
       𝐴𝐵       𝐵𝐶        𝐶𝐴         1
    • ′ ′ = ′ ′ = ′ ′ = .
      𝐴𝐵       𝐵𝐶        𝐶 𝐴         𝑘
                          𝑃 𝐴′ 𝐵′ 𝐶 ′
    • Perimeter ratio is               = 𝑘.
                            𝑃 𝐴𝐵𝐶
                    [ 𝐴′ 𝐵 ′ 𝐶 ′ ]
    • Area ratio is                = 𝑘 2.
                      [ 𝐴𝐵𝐶]
    • Altitudes, medians, and angle bisectors scale by 𝑘.

   Example

                                                                  𝐴𝐵      ℎ 𝐴𝐵
   A quick proof (altitudes scale by 𝑘): In similar triangles,          = ′      because both pairs
                                                                 𝐴′ 𝐵 ′  ℎ 𝐴′ 𝐵′
   are opposite equal angles and form similar right triangles when dropping perpendiculars. Hence
   ℎ′𝐴′ 𝐵′ = 𝑘 ℎ 𝐴𝐵 .

   Shortcut
   Area shortcut: If sides scale by 𝑘, areas scale by 𝑘 2 . If perimeters scale by 3, areas scale by 9.
