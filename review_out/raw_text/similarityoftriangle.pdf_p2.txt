Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10)                                                     1


Overview: What is Similarity?
   Definition                                          Shortcut
   Two figures are similar if they have the same       Quick check: If two angles of one triangle
   shape. For triangles, this means:                   match two of another, triangles are similar
    • Corresponding angles are equal.                  (AAA). You do not need the third angle.
    • Corresponding side lengths are in pro-
      portion.
   We write: △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐴′ 𝐵′ 𝐶 ′ .
                                                                                               𝐶′
   Property

   Scale factor 𝑘: If △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐴′ 𝐵′ 𝐶 ′ , and
                            𝐴′ 𝐵 ′                       𝐶
   𝐴𝐵 matches 𝐴′ 𝐵′ , then         = 𝑘. Every                                        scale 𝑘
                             𝐴𝐵
   corresponding side scales by 𝑘.
    • Perimeters scale by 𝑘.
    • Areas scale by 𝑘 2 .                                                   𝐵         𝐴′

   tex order consistent. If △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐷𝐸 𝐹,
   then 𝐴 ↔ 𝐷, 𝐵 ↔ 𝐸, 𝐶 ↔ 𝐹. So                        Keep order: △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐷𝐸 𝐹 means
    𝐴𝐵    𝐵𝐶 𝐶 𝐴                                       𝐴 ↔ 𝐷, 𝐵 ↔ 𝐸, 𝐶 ↔ 𝐹. Mixing order
        =      =     .                                 gives wrong ratios.
