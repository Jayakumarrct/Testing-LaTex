                                          AB   AC
Step 1: From △ABC ∼ △DEF , we get            =    and ∠A = ∠D.                        (similar triangles)
                                          DE   DF
Step 2: Since BM, EN are medians, AM = 12 AC and DN = 12 DF .                     (definition of median)
                      1
                AM      AC   AC
Step 3: Hence      = 12    =    .                                          (halves of proportional sides)
                DN   2  DF   DF
                                            AB   AM
Step 4: Combining steps 1 and 3, we have       =    .                               (transitive property)
                                            DE   DN
                                                          AB   AM
Step 5: In △ABM and △DEN , we have ∠A = ∠D and               =    .                (from steps 1 and 4)
                                                          DE   DN
Step 6: Conclude △ABM ∼ △DEN .                                                          (SAS similarity)
                                BM   AB
Step 7: From this similarity,      =    .                      (corresponding sides in similar triangles)
                                EN   DE
                AB   AC                                BM   AC
Step 8: Since      =    (from step 1), we can conclude    =    .                    (transitive property)
                DE   DF                                EN   DF

                                     BM   AC
Answer: (i) △ABM ∼ △DEN ; (ii)          =    .

Question 6

Question: In the given figure, △ABC is isosceles with AC = BC and AP × BQ = AC 2 . Prove that
△ACP ∼ △BCQ.
Solution Given: △ABC is isosceles with AC = BC and AP · BQ = AC 2 .
To Prove: △ACP ∼ △BCQ.


                                                   C


                                                         Q
                                            P



                                      A                         B


Step 1: Note: The condition AP · BQ = AC 2 together with AC = BC is not sufficient to conclude
        △ACP ∼ △BCQ.
Step 2: The previous version incorrectly used ∠CAP = ∠CBQ; this is generally false because P ∈ AC
        and Q ∈ BC make ∠CAP degenerate.
                                            AP   AC
Step 3: From AP · BQ = AC · BC we get          =    , but this ratio alone does not fix the angles at C
                                            BC   BQ
        in △ACP and △BCQ.
Step 4: A common correct variant assumes additional angle/ratio information (for example, equal angles
        at C), after which SAS can be applied.

Answer: As stated, the data are insufficient to prove the claimed similarity without an extra condition
at C.
