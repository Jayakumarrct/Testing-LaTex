 Step 1: Part (i):

 Step 2: Since DE ∥ BC, △ADE ∼ △ABC.           (AA similarity, common angle A, corresponding angles)

 Step 3: Since DE ∥ BC, and N is on BC, DE ∥ BN. This makes △DM E ∼ △N M B.           (AA similarity,
         vertically opposite angles at M, alternate interior angles)

 Step 4: Part (ii):
                                                    AE   DE
 Step 5: From △ADE ∼ △ABC, we have the ratio           =    .
                                                    AC   BC
 Step 6: AC = AE + EC = 15 + 9 = 24 cm.

 Step 7: BC = BN + N C = 24 + 6 = 30 cm.

 Step 8:      =    =⇒   =    .                                       (substitution and simplification)

                 5 × 30   150
 Step 9: DE =           =     = 18.75 cm.                                                   (algebra)

Step 10: From △DM E ∼ △N M B, we have          =    =    .

                         DE   18.75   75/4   75   25
Step 11: Use the ratio      =       =      =    =    .
                         NB    24      24    96   32
               ME   25                    25
Step 12: So,      =    . This means M E =    M B.

                                                25           57
Step 13: Since BE = M E + M B, we have BE =        MB + MB =    M B.
                                                32           32
Step 14: We cannot find the absolute length of ME without knowing the length of BE. The problem is
         missing information. The same applies to DM.

 Answer: (i) △ADE ∼ △ABC and △DM E ∼ △N M B. (ii) The lengths cannot be uniquely determined.

 The ratios are    =    and    =    .

 Question 10

 Question: In the given figure, D is on AB, E is on AC, AD = AE and AD2 = BD × EC. Prove that
 triangles ABD and CAE are similar. Correction based on typical problems: This problem is only
 solvable with standard theorems if we assume an additional property, for instance that ∠B = ∠C.
 Solution Given: AD = AE and AD2 = BD × EC. D on AB, E on AC.
 To Prove: △ABD ∼ △CAE, assuming ∠B = ∠C.
