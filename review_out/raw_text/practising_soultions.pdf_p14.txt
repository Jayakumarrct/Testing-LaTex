Step 1: Let AE : ED = m : n (unknown from the data). Then the line through E parallel to the bases
        cuts off a segment EF whose length is the weighted mean of the bases:
                                                     n AB + m DC
                                              EF =               .
                                                        m+n
                                                                (similar triangles along the transversals)

Step 2: Without m : n (or AD), neither EC nor EF can be uniquely determined.

Answer: Additional information (e.g., AE : ED) is required. In general, if AE : ED = m : n, then
     n AB + m DC
EF =               .
        m+n

                 AP     4

                                                                            C

                          A


                                                                     Q
                                                P




                                                            B


Step 1: Part (i): Consider △BP Q and △BAC.

Step 2: Since P Q ∥ AC, ∠BP Q = ∠BAC and ∠BQP = ∠BCA.                             (corresponding angles)

Step 3: ∠B is common to both triangles.

Step 4: Therefore, △BP Q ∼ △BAC.                                                        (AAA similarity)
                                              BP   BQ   PQ
Step 5: The ratio of corresponding sides is      =    =    .
                                              BA   BC   AC
                                                                            BP   3k  3
Step 6: Given AP : P B = 4 : 3, so AB = AP + P B = 4k + 3k = 7k. Thus          =    = .
                                                                            BA   7k  7
Step 7: Hence, P Q : AC = 3 : 7.

Step 8: Part (ii): Consider △BQS and △BCR.

Step 9: ∠BSQ = ∠BRC = 90◦ (assuming S is on BQ, R on BC).

Step 10: ∠QBS = ∠CBR (common angle B).

Step 11: So △BQS ∼ △BCR.
