 median PM respectively. Prove (i) △ABD ∼ △P QM ; (ii) △ABC ∼ △P QR.
                 AB   BC    AD
 Solution Given:    =     =      ; D, M are midpoints of BC, QR.
                 PQ   QR    PM
 To Prove: (i) △ABD ∼ △P QM ; (ii) △ABC ∼ △P QR.


                         A                                    P




                  B              D              C        Q           M              R


 Step 1: Part (i):
                        AB   BC   AD
 Step 2: We are given      =    =    .
                        PQ   QR   PM
 Step 3: Since D and M are midpoints, BC = 2BD and QR = 2QM .                    (definition of median)
                                                AB   2BD   AD
 Step 4: Substitute this into the proportion:      =     =    .
                                                PQ   2QM   PM
                              AB   BD   AD
 Step 5: This simplifies to      =    =    .                                            (cancel factor 2)
                              PQ   QM   PM
 Step 6: In △ABD and △P QM , all three pairs of corresponding sides are in proportion.
 Step 7: Therefore, △ABD ∼ △P QM .                                                      (SSS similarity)
 Step 8: Part (ii):
 Step 9: From the similarity in part (i), we know that corresponding angles are equal. So, ∠B = ∠Q.
                                                AB   BC
Step 10: In △ABC and △P QR, we are given           =    .
                                                PQ   QR
Step 11: We have two pairs of sides in proportion and the included angles (∠B, ∠Q) are equal.
Step 12: Therefore, △ABC ∼ △P QR.                                                       (SAS similarity)

 Answer: (i) △ABD ∼ △P QM . (ii) △ABC ∼ △P QR.
