Step 11: From AB ↔ DF and BC ↔ DE, vertex B must correspond to vertex D.
Step 12: From BC ↔ DE and AC ↔ F E, vertex C must correspond to vertex E.
Step 13: This leaves vertex A corresponding to vertex F.
Step 14: Therefore, the correct similarity statement is △ABC ∼ △F DE.

 Answer: The triangles are similar by SSS. The correct correspondence is △ABC ∼ △F DE.




 Question 6

Question: In trapezium ABCD with AB ∥ DC, diagonals intersect at P. Prove (i) △AP B ∼ △CP D;
(ii) P A · P D = P B · P C.
 Solution Given: Trapezium ABCD with AB ∥ DC, diagonals AC and BD intersect at P.
 To Prove: (i) △AP B ∼ △CP D; (ii) P A · P D = P B · P C.


                                      A                                B


                                                  P


                                          D                 C

 Step 1: Part (i): Consider △AP B and △CP D.
 Step 2: Since AB ∥ DC, ∠P AB = ∠P CD.                                          (alternate interior angles)
 Step 3: Similarly, ∠P BA = ∠P DC.                                              (alternate interior angles)
 Step 4: Also, ∠AP B = ∠CP D.                                                  (vertically opposite angles)
 Step 5: Therefore, △AP B ∼ △CP D.                                                       (AAA similarity)
 Step 6: Part (ii): From the similarity proved in part (i), the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.

                                                           PA   PB
 Step 8: Taking the first two parts of the proportion:        =    .
                                                           PC   PD
 Step 9: Cross-multiply to get P A · P D = P B · P C.                                            (algebra)

 Answer: (i) The triangles are similar. (ii) The product equality is proved.
