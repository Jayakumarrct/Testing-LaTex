                                      P


                                                  M




                                     Q                        R


 Step 1: Part (i): Consider △P M Q and △P QR.

 Step 2: ∠P M Q = ∠P QR = 90◦ .                                                             (given)

 Step 3: ∠M P Q = ∠QP R (or ∠P ).                                                  (common angle)

 Step 4: Therefore, △P M Q ∼ △P QR.                                                (AA similarity)
                            PQ   PM
 Step 5: From similarity,      =    .                                         (corresponding sides)
                            PR   PQ

 Step 6: Cross-multiplying gives P Q2 = P M × P R .

 Step 7: Part (ii): Consider △QM R and △P QR.

 Step 8: ∠QM R = ∠P QR = 90◦ .                                                              (given)

 Step 9: ∠M RQ = ∠P RQ (or ∠R).                                                    (common angle)

Step 10: Therefore, △QM R ∼ △P QR.                                                 (AA similarity)
                            QR   MR
Step 11: From similarity,      =    .                                         (corresponding sides)
                            PR   QR

Step 12: Cross-multiplying gives QR2 = P R × M R .

Step 13: Part (iii): Add the results from (i) and (ii).

Step 14: P Q2 + QR2 = (P M × P R) + (M R × P R).                                         (addition)

Step 15: Factor out PR: P Q2 + QR2 = P R × (P M + M R).                      (distributive property)

Step 16: Since P, M, R are collinear, P M + M R = P R.                          (segment addition)

Step 17: Substitute to get P Q2 + QR2 = P R2 .


 Answer: All three parts are proved.
