 Question 5

 Question: Given: ∠GHE = ∠DF E = 90◦ , DH = 8, DF = 12, DG = 3x - 1 and DE = 4x + 2. Find the
 lengths of segments DG and DE. Correction based on typical problems: The most likely intended
 similarity is between △DGH and △DEF . This requires ∠DHG = ∠DF E = 90◦ or GH —— EF. The
 question states ∠DF E = 90◦ . Let’s assume the intended similarity is △DGH ∼ △DEF .
 Solution Given: △DGH and △DEF with common angle D. DH=8, DF=12, DG=3x-1, DE=4x+2.
 To Prove: Find the lengths of DG and DE.

                                H




                                D                       G          F


 Step 1: Assume the intended similarity is △DGH ∼ △DEF . This implies the vertices correspond in
         that order.
                                               DG   DH   GH
 Step 2: The ratio of corresponding sides is      =    =    .      (definition of similar triangles)
                                               DE   DF   EF
                                                   DG   DH
 Step 3: Using the first two parts of the ratio:      =    .               (property of similarity)
                                                   DE   DF
                                        3x − 1    8
 Step 4: Substitute the given values:          =    .                                (substitution)
                                        4x + 2   12
                                8  2
 Step 5: Simplify the ratio:      = .                                              (simplification)
                               12  3
                                3x − 1  2
 Step 6: Set up the equation:          = .
                                4x + 2  3
 Step 7: Cross-multiply: 3(3x − 1) = 2(4x + 2).                                           (algebra)

 Step 8: Solve for x: 9x − 3 = 8x + 4 =⇒ x = 7.                                           (algebra)

 Step 9: Calculate DG: DG = 3x − 1 = 3(7) − 1 = 20.                                  (substitution)

Step 10: Calculate DE: DE = 4x + 2 = 4(7) + 2 = 30.                                  (substitution)

 Answer: DG = 20 and DE = 30.
