                              A                   L            B




                                                                    P

                                        D                               C

 Step 1: Part (i): Consider △DP C and △LP B.
 Step 2: Since AL is an extension of AB, and AB ∥ DC, we have AL ∥ DC.
 Step 3: ∠P DC = ∠P LB (or ∠P LA).                                              (alternate interior angles)
 Step 4: ∠P CD = ∠P BL.                                        (alternate interior angles, since AD ∥ BC)
 Step 5: Therefore, △DP C ∼ △LP B.                                                        (AA similarity)
                                             DP     PC     DC
 Step 6: The ratio of corresponding sides is      =      =     .
                                             LP     PB     LB
                                                  DP     DC
 Step 7: From this, we get the required relation:      =     .
                                                  PL      BL
                                                         PL      BL
 Step 8: Part (ii): Start with the result from part (i):     =      .                 (inverting the ratio)
                                                         DP     DC
                                PL         BL
 Step 9: Add 1 to both sides:       +1=        + 1.                                              (algebra)
                                DP         DC
                          P L + DP       BL + DC
Step 10: Combine terms:               =           .
                             DP             DC
Step 11: Since D, P, L are collinear, P L + DP = DL.
Step 12: Since A, B, L are collinear, BL + AB = AL. Also, AB = DC in a parallelogram.
                                                DL   BL + AB   AL
Step 13: Substitute these into the equation:       =         =    .
                                                DP     DC      DC

 Answer: Both proportions are proved.
