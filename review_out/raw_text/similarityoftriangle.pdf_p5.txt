Key Theorems from Similarity
   Theorem/Rule
   Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales): If a line through a triangle is parallel to one side, it
   divides the other two sides proportionally.
                                 𝐴𝐷     𝐴𝐸      𝐴𝐷   𝐴𝐸
   If 𝐷𝐸 ∥ 𝐵𝐶 in △𝐴𝐵𝐶, then          =      and    =    .

                                           𝐶

                                                                   𝐵
                                                    𝐷
                                   𝐴


   Example

   Proof idea: Since 𝐷𝐸 ∥ 𝐵𝐶, ∠ 𝐴𝐷𝐸 = ∠ 𝐴𝐵𝐶 and ∠ 𝐴𝐸 𝐷 = ∠ 𝐴𝐶 𝐵 (alternate interior angles).
                                 𝐴𝐷   𝐴𝐸      𝐷𝐸     𝐴𝐷    𝐴𝐸                    𝐴𝐷    𝐴𝐸
   Thus △𝐴𝐷𝐸 ∼ △𝐴𝐵𝐶 (AAA), so       =     and      =    =      . From the first,     =     .

   Theorem/Rule
   Converse of BPT: If a line through a triangle cuts two sides proportionally, it is parallel to the
   third side.

                                                                                    𝐵𝐷   𝐴𝐵
   Angle Bisector Theorem (internal): In △𝐴𝐵𝐶, if 𝐴𝐷 bisects ∠ 𝐴 with 𝐷 on 𝐵𝐶, then    =    .
                                                                                    𝐷𝐶   𝐴𝐶

   External bisector at 𝐴 meets the extension of 𝐵𝐶 at 𝐸 and gives    =    .

   Example

   Right-triangle similarity facts:
    • In right △𝐴𝐵𝐶 with right angle at 𝐶, altitude from 𝐶 to hypotenuse 𝐴𝐵 meets 𝐴𝐵 at 𝐻. Then
      △𝐴𝐶𝐻 ∼ △𝐴𝐵𝐶 ∼ △𝐻𝐶 𝐵.
    • Mean proportionals: 𝐶𝐻 2 = 𝐴𝐻 · 𝐻𝐵, 𝐴𝐶 2 = 𝐴𝐻 · 𝐴𝐵, 𝐵𝐶 2 = 𝐻𝐵 · 𝐴𝐵.
    • Pythagoras by similarity: From 𝐴𝐶 2 = 𝐴𝐻 · 𝐴𝐵 and 𝐵𝐶 2 = 𝐻𝐵 · 𝐴𝐵, add to get 𝐴𝐶 2 + 𝐵𝐶 2 =
