Question 2

Question: In the figure, straight lines AB and CD intersect at P, and AC —— BD. Prove that: (i)
△AP C and △BP D are similar. (ii) If BD = 2.4 cm, AC = 3.6 cm, PD = 4.0 cm and PB = 3.2 cm, find
the lengths of PA and PC.

To Prove: (i) △AP C ∼ △BP D; (ii) find P A, P C.


                                     A
                                                                 C


                                                     P



                                     D
                                                                 B


Step 1: ∠P AC = ∠P BD and ∠P CA = ∠P DB.                          (alternate interior angles, AC ∥ BD)

Step 2: ∠AP C = ∠BP D.                                                             (vertically opposite)

Step 3: Conclude △AP C ∼ △BP D.                                                       (AAA similarity)
                                                PA   PC   AC
Step 4: Use the ratio of corresponding sides:      =    =    .                       (similar triangles)
                                                PB   PD   BD
                                         PA    PC    3.6
Step 5: Substitute the given lengths:        =     =     .                                (substitution)
                                         3.2   4.0   2.4
                               3.6   3
Step 6: Calculate the ratio:       =   = 1.5.                                           (simplification)
                               2.4   2
                         PA
Step 7: Solve for P A:       = 1.5 =⇒     P A = 4.8 cm .                                      (algebra)
                         3.2
                         PC
Step 8: Solve for P C:       = 1.5 =⇒      P C = 6.0 cm .                                     (algebra)
                         4.0

Answer: (i) △AP C ∼ △BP D. (ii) P A = 4.8 cm, P C = 6.0 cm.




Question 3

Question: In a trapezium ABCD, AB ∥ DC. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. If BO = 6 cm and
DQ = 8 cm, find BP × DO. (Note: as written, this appears incomplete/ambiguous.) Note: We establish
the standard diagonal proportionality in a trapezium and refrain from speculative numerical conclusions.
Solution Given: Trapezium ABCD with AB ∥ DC. Diagonals intersect at O.
To Prove: A relationship between the segments of the diagonals.
