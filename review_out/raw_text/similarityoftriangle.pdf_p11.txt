 Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10)                                                           10


 Pitfalls and Checks
     Warning

      • Wrong order: Always match letters correctly when writing ratios.
      • SAS uses included angle: The equal angle must be between the two compared sides.
      • 𝑘 vs 𝑘 2 : Perimeter uses 𝑘, area uses 𝑘 2 .
      • Rounding: Keep sufficient precision; round only at the end.
      • Not to scale: Diagrams may mislead; rely on given measures.
