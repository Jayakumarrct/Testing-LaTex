                                   A                            B


                                                O


                                       D                  C


Step 1: In △AOB and △COD, ∠OAB = ∠OCD and ∠OBA = ∠ODC.                     (alternate interior angles,
        AB ∥ DC)

Step 2: Also, ∠AOB = ∠COD.                                                (vertically opposite angles)

Step 3: Hence △AOB ∼ △COD.                                                         (AAA similarity)
                    OA   OB
Step 4: Therefore      =    , so OA · OD = OB · OC.                            (corresponding sides)
                    OC   OD
Step 5: The given numerics (BO = 6, DQ = 8) do not determine BP ·DO without additional relationships
        between P, Q and the diagonals.

Answer: △AOB ∼ △COD and OA · OD = OB · OC. The product BP · DO cannot be found from the
given data alone.




Question 4

Question: In △ABC, BM ⊥ AC and CN ⊥ AB; show that AB   BM   AM
                                                  AC = CN = AN .

Solution Given: In △ABC, BM ⊥ AC and CN ⊥ AB.
          AB     BM    AM
To Prove:     =      =    .
          AC     CN    AN


                                               C
                                              M



                                                                B

                                                    N
                                   A


Step 1: Consider △AM B and △AN C.

Step 2: ∠AM B = 90◦ and ∠AN C = 90◦ .                                 (given, BM ⊥ AC, CN ⊥ AB)

Step 3: ∠M AB = ∠N AC (or ∠A).                                                       (common angle)

Step 4: Therefore, △AM B ∼ △AN C.                                                    (AA similarity)
                                                          AB   BM   AM
Step 5: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal:      =    =    .     (corresponding sides of
                                                          AC   CN   AN
       similar triangles)

Answer: The relationship is proved.
