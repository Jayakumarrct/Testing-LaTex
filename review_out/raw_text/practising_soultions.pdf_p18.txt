 Step 7: 6x + 3 = 36 =⇒ 6x = 33 =⇒ x = 5.5.

 Step 8: Now calculate the lengths of the sides for both triangles.

 Step 9: For △ABC:

Step 10: AB = 2x + 1 = 2(5.5) + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12 cm.

Step 11: AC = 4x = 4(5.5) = 22 cm.
                                     BC  2
Step 12: To find BC, use the ratio      = . First find DE.
                                     DE  3
Step 13: DE = 3(x + 1) = 3(5.5 + 1) = 3(6.5) = 19.5 cm.
                 2       2
Step 14: BC =      × DE = × 19.5 = 13 cm.
                 3       3
Step 15: For △ADE:

Step 16: AD = 18 cm.

Step 17: AE = 6x = 6(5.5) = 33 cm.

Step 18: DE = 19.5 cm.

 Answer: x = 5.5.



 Sides of △ABC: AB=12 cm, AC=22 cm, BC=13 cm. Sides of △ADE: AD=18 cm, AE=33 cm, DE=19.5
 cm.


 Question 5

 Question: In △ABC and △DEF , AB = 3x·DF, BC = 3x·DE and AC = 3x·EF. Show the triangles are
 similar and name them properly.
 Solution Given: Relationships between the sides of △ABC and △DEF .
 To Prove: Show similarity and provide the correct correspondence.



 Step 1: From the given equations, form ratios of corresponding sides.
                                        AB
 Step 2: From AB = 3x · DF , we get        = 3x.
                                        DF
                                        BC
 Step 3: From BC = 3x · DE, we get         = 3x.
                                        DE
                                        AC
 Step 4: From AC = 3x · EF , we get        = 3x.
                                        EF
                   AB   BC   AC
 Step 5: We have      =    =    = 3x.
                   DF   DE   EF
 Step 6: Since the ratios of all three pairs of sides are equal, the triangles are similar.   (SSS similarity)

 Step 7: To name them properly, match the corresponding vertices from the ratios:

 Step 8: Side AB corresponds to DF.

 Step 9: Side BC corresponds to DE.

Step 10: Side AC corresponds to FE.
