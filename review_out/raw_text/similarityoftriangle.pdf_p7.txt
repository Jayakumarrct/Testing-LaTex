Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10)                                                       6


Worked Examples
   Example

   Type A: Find an unknown side using similarity
   In △𝐴𝐵𝐶, 𝐷𝐸 ∥ 𝐵𝐶 with 𝐷 on 𝐴𝐵 and 𝐸 on 𝐴𝐶. If 𝐴𝐷 = 6, 𝐴𝐵 = 9, and 𝐴𝐸 = 8, find 𝐴𝐶.

                                     𝐸




                                                        𝐷            𝐵
                                 𝐴


   Steps
   1. 𝐷𝐸 ∥ 𝐵𝐶 ⇒ △𝐴𝐷𝐸 ∼ △𝐴𝐵𝐶.
      𝐴𝐷     𝐴𝐸      6    8
   2.     =      ⇒ =        .
      𝐴𝐵     𝐴𝐶      9 𝐴𝐶
   3. Cross-multiply: 6 𝐴𝐶 = 9 · 8 = 72.
   4. 𝐴𝐶 = 12.

      Shortcut
      Use BPT: a single proportion solves it.


   Example

   Type B: Perimeter and area comparisons
                                                5
   Two similar triangles have side ratio 𝑘 = . If the smaller has perimeter 24 and area 54, find the
                                                3
   larger’s perimeter and area.
   Steps
                                                  5
   1. Perimeter scales by 𝑘: 𝑃large = 𝑘 · 24 = · 24 = 40.
                                                  3
                                                2
                                                5        25
   2. Area scales by 𝑘 2 : 𝐴large = 𝑘 2 · 54 =      54 =    · 54 = 150.
                                                3        9
      Shortcut

      Perimeter ×𝑘, area ×𝑘 2 . Keep which triangle is larger consistent.


   Example

   Type C: Angle-bisector splits a side
   In △𝐴𝐵𝐶, 𝐴𝐷 bisects ∠ 𝐴. If 𝐴𝐵 = 7, 𝐴𝐶 = 9, and 𝐵𝐶 = 12, find 𝐵𝐷 and 𝐷𝐶.
