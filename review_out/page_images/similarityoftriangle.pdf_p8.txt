Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 7
c
D

Steps
1. Angle Bisector Theorem: BD _AB_?

oa “DC > ACO
2. Let BD = 7x, DC = 9x, then 7x + 9x = 12 > x= a = a
3. BD = 7x = 5.25, DC = 9x = 6.75.

Split in the ratio of the adjacent sides.
Type D: Parallel line cuts triangle
In AABC, DE || BC with AD = 5, DB =7, AE = 6. Find EC.

ES DB EC 7 > EC
2. Cross-multiply: 5 EC = 42 > EC = 8.4.

Set up the proportion once; check order carefully.

Type E: Shadow / scale-model problem
At the same time, a tree casts a 9 m shadow and a 1.5 m stick casts a 1.2 m shadow. How tall is the
tree?
