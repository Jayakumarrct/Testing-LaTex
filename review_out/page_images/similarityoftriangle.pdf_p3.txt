Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 2
Core Definitions and Similarity Criteria
Similar triangles: AABC ~ AA’B’C’ if ZA = ZA’, ZB = ZB’, LC = ZC’ (AAA), or if certain
side-angle conditions hold (SAS, SSS).

Common mistakes
* Using a non-included angle for SAS.
* Mismatching corresponding sides when writing ratios.
+ Forgetting that areas scale by k?, not by k.
