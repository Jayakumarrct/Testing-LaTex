Step 7: 62 +3=36 => 6r=33 = x=55.
Step 8: Now calculate the lengths of the sides for both triangles.
Step 9: For AABC:
Step 10: AB = 27 +1=2(5.5)+1=1141= 12cm.
Step I: AC = 4a = 4(5.5) = 22 em.
Step 12: To find BC, use the ratio be = 2 First find DE.
DE 3
Step 13: DE = 3(a@ + 1) = 3(5.5 + 1) = 3(6.5) = 19.5 em.
Step 14: BC = ; x DE= ; x 19.5 = 13 cm.
Step 15: For AADE:
Step 16: AD = 18 cm.
Step 17; AE = 6x = 6(5.5) = 33 cm.
Step 18: DE = 19.5 cm.
Answer: x = 5.5.
Sides of AABC: AB=12 cm, AC=22 cm, BC=13 cm. Sides of AADE: AD=18 cm, AE=33 cm, DE=19.5
cm.
Question 5
Question: In AABC and ADEF, AB = 3x-DF, BC = 3x-DE and AC = 3x-EF. Show the triangles are
similar and name them properly.
Solution Given: Relationships between the sides of AABC and ADEF.
To Prove: Show similarity and provide the correct correspondence.
Step 1: From the given equations, form ratios of corresponding sides.
AB
Step 2: From AB = 3x: DF, we get DF 3x.
BC
Step 3: From BC = 3r- DE, we get 5 = 30.
AC
tep 4: Fi AC = 32+ EF, we get — = 32.
Step rom AC cr we ge EF 3a.
AB BC _ AC
ti : We have — = — = —— = 3z.
Step 5: We have DF ~ DE~ EF 3a.
Step 6: Since the ratios of all three pairs of sides are equal, the triangles are similar. (55 similarity)
Step 7: To name them properly, match the corresponding vertices from the ratios:
Step 8: Side AB corresponds to DF.
Step 9: Side BC corresponds to DE.
Step 10: Side AC corresponds to FE.
