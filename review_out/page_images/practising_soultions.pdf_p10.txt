Step 1: The given condition is AD? = BD x EC.
Step 2: Since AD = AE, we can substitute AE for one AD: AD x AE = BD x EC. (substitution)
AD BD
Step 3: Rearrange this into a proportion: 5G = Fy (algebra)
Step 4: To prove AABD ~ ACAE, we would need the included angles to be equal, i.e., ZBDA = ZAEC,
or another pair of sides in proportion, or a pair of non-included angles to be equal.
Step 5: The given information is insufficient. However, if we assume AABC is isosceles with AB = AC,
then ZB = ZC.
Step 6: With AB = AC and AD = AE, we subtract to get AB — AD = AC — AE, which means
BD= EC.
Step 7: The condition AD? = BD x EC becomes AD? = BD*, so AD = BD.
Step 8: This means AE = EC. So D and E are midpoints of AB and AC.
Step 9: In this specific case, AABD and AC-AE become congruent isosceles triangles, and are therefore
similar.
Answer: The problem as stated is not solvable without additional assumptions. If we assume AABC is
isosceles with AB = AC, the similarity holds.
Question 11
Question: State, true or false: (i) Two similar polygons are necessarily congruent. (ii) Two congruent
polygons are necessarily similar. (iii) All equiangular triangles are similar. (iv) All isosceles triangles are
similar. (v) Two isosceles right triangles are similar. (vi) The diagonals of a trapezium divide each other
into proportional segments.
Solution Given: Statements about geometric figures.
To Prove: Determine if each statement is True or False.
Step 1: (i) False. Similarity means same shape, but not necessarily the same size. A small square is
similar to a large square, but they are not congruent.
Step 2: (ii) True. Congruent polygons have corresponding angles equal and corresponding sides equal.
This means the ratio of corresponding sides is 1, so they are similar.
Step 3: (iii) True. An equiangular triangle is an equilateral triangle, with all angles being 60°. Any two
such triangles are similar by AAA similarity.
Step 4: (iv) False. An isosceles triangle could have angles 50-50-80, while another could have 70-70-40.
Their angles are not the same, so they are not similar.
