Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 10
Pitfalls and Checks
* Wrong order: Always match letters correctly when writing ratios.
+ SAS uses included angle: The equal angle must be between the two compared sides.
* k vs k?: Perimeter uses k, area uses k?.
* Rounding: Keep sufficient precision; round only at the end.
* Not to scale: Diagrams may mislead; rely on given measures.
Practice Problems
1. In AABC, DE || BC, AD = 3, AB =9, AE =5. Find AC.
2. Two similar triangles have k = 4. If the smaller area is 27, find the larger area.
3. In AABC, AD bisects ZA. If AB = 8, AC = 10, BC = 18, find BD and DC.
4. Inright AABC with right angle at C, altitude to hypotenuse meets at H, AH = 5, HB = 9. Find CH,
AC, BC.

10. If AB = BC = cA = 3, what is the area ratio [DEF],
DE EF FD [ABC]
11. Sides AB = 6, AC = 10. If AD bisects ZA meeting BC at D and BD = 7.2, find BC.
12. Points A(0,0), B(3, 1), C(0,2). Points D(0,0), E(6,2), F(0,4). Are AABC and ADEF similar?
State k.
13. In AABC, a line through A meets BC at D with aa = 3. Prove the line is parallel to AB or AC?
Which?
14. AABC ~ APQR with AB = 12, BC = 15, CA = 9 and PQ = 16. Find k and QR, RP.
15. In right AABC with ZC = 90°, AC = 9, BC = 12. Find AB using similarity (not directly by
Pythagoras).
16. A2 m stick casts 1.6 m shadow. A building casts 24 m shadow at the same time. Find the building
height.
17. If AABC ~ ADEF and AB = BC = k, express [DEF] in terms of k.
DE EF [ABC]
18. In AABC, DE || BC with AD =7, AE = 10, AC = 15. Find AB.
19. In AABC, AD bisects ZA and meets BC at D. If AB: AC = 5: 7 and BC = 18, find BD and DC.
20. Coordinates: A(1, 1), B(5,3), C(2, 6) and A’(2, 2), B’(10, 6), C’(4, 12). Check similarity and find k.
