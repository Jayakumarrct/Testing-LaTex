Question 6

Question: In APQR, ZQ = 90째 and QM is perpendicular to PR. Prove that: (i) PQ? = PM x PR (ii)

QR? = PR x MR (iii) PQ? + QR? = PR?

Solution Given: APQR with ZPQR = 90째 and altitude QM L PR.

To Prove: The three geometric mean relationships.

P
y M
aa
Q R

Step 1: Part (i): Consider APMQ and APQR.

Step 2: ZPMQ = ZPQR = 90째. (given)

Step 3: ZMPQ = ZQPR (or ZP). (common angle)

Step 4: Therefore, APMQ ~ APQR. (AA similarity)

4 PQ PM

Step 5: From similarity, 55 = Po: (corresponding sides)

Step 6: Cross-multiplying gives | PQ? = PM x PR |.

Step 7: Part (ii): Consider AQMR and APQR.

Step 8: ZQMR = ZPQR = 90째. (given)

Step 9: ZMRQ = ZPRQ (or ZR). (common angle)
Step 10: Therefore, AQMR ~ APQR. (AA similarity)

M.

Step 11: From similarity, on = or (corresponding sides)
Step 12: Cross-multiplying gives] QR? = PR x MR |.
Step 13: Part (iii): Add the results from (i) and (ii).
Step 14: PQ? + QR? = (PM x PR) + (MR x PR). (addition)
Step 15: Factor out PR: PQ? + QR? = PR x (PM + MR). (distributive property)
Step 16: Since P, M, R are collinear, PM + MR = PR. (segment addition)
Step 17: Substitute to get] PQ? + QR? = PR? |.

Answer: All three parts are proved.
