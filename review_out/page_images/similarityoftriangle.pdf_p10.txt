Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 9
Formula and Fact Sheet
Topic Key Facts / Formulas
Similarity notation AABC ~ AA‘B’C’; keep vertex order.
AB’ _ BIC’ _ CA’
Scale factor k=—— = —— = —.
AB BC CA
Angle equality LA = LA’, LB = 2B’, LC = LC".
AAA Three equal angles = triangles similar.
SAS Two side ratios equal and included angle equal = similar.
SSS Three side ratios equal (same k) => similar.
Perimeter Py =kP).
Area [42] = k? [Ai].
Medians/altitudes/bisectors Scale by & in similar triangles.
BPT If DE || BC in AABC, then AD = AE and AD = AE
, DB EC AB AC’

Converse BPT If a line cuts two sides proportionally, it is parallel to the third.

; _ BD _ AB _BE_ AB
Angle Bisector Thm Internal: De AC External: ECAC
Right-triangle similarity With altitude to hypotenuse: CH? = AH - HB, AC? = AH - AB,

BC? = HB- AB.

Pythagoras (via similarity) AC? + BC? = AB?.
Word problems Heights/shadows or scale models: use height/shadow ratios.
