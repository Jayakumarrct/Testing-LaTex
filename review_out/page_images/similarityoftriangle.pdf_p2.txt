Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 1
Overview: What is Similarity?

Two figures are similar if they have the same Quick check: If two angles of one triangle
shape. For triangles, this means: match two of another, triangles are similar
* Corresponding angles are equal. (AAA). You do not need the third angle.

* Corresponding side lengths are in pro-

portion.
We write: AABC ~ AA’B’C’.
Cc
Scale factor k: If AABC ~ AA’B’C’, and
‘A’B’ Cc

AB matches A’B’, then 7a © k. Every scale k
corresponding side scales by k.

* Perimeters scale by k.

* Areas scale by k?. ”

A

Matching corresponding parts: Keep ver-

tex order consistent. If AABC ~ ADEF,

thn Ao D, B © E,C © F. So Keep order: AABC ~ ADial means
AB BC CA Ao D,Be E,C © F. Mixing order
DE EF FD’ gives wrong ratios.
