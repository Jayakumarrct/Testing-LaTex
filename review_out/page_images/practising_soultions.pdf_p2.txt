Step 5: Conclude AABL ~ ADEM. (SAS similarity)
AL _AB_ BC . a
Step 6: Hence 55> = pp = BF (corresponding sides in similar triangles)

Answer: EF DM’
Question 4
Question: In AABC, AD is perpendicular to side BC and AD? = BD x CD. Prove that ZBAC = 90°.
Solution Given: AD | BC and AD? = BD-CD.
To Prove: ZBAC = 90°.
A
B D c
Step 1: In AADB, AB? = AD? + BD?. (Pythagoras in right AADB)
Step 2: In AADC, AC? = AD? + CD?. (Pythagoras in right AADC)
Step 3: Add: AB? + AC? = 2AD? + BD? + CD?. (add equations)
Step 4: Substitute AD? = BD - CD to get AB? + AC? = (BD + CD)? = [Bc?] (given and
BC = BD+CD)
Step 5: Conclude ZBAC = 90°. (converse of Pythagoras)
Answer: ZBAC = 90°.
