Exercise 15C Solutions
Question 2
Question: In triangles ABC and PQR, sides AB, BC and median AD are proportional to PQ, QR and
median PM respectively. Prove (i) AABD ~ APQM; (ii) AABC ~ APQR.
AB BC AD
Solution Given: <= = [= = ——,; p, M are midpoints of BC, QR.
aaa PQ QR. PM
To Prove: (i) AABD ~ APQM; (ii) AABC ~ APQR.
A P
B D Cc Q M R
Step 1: Part (i):
AB BC AD
Step 2: We are given 22 _ BC _ AD
PQ QR PM
Step 3: Since D and M are midpoints, BC = 2BD and QR = 2QM. (definition of median)
AB 2BD AD
Step 4: Substitute this into the proportion: —2 =~ = =~.
PQ 2QM PM
AB BD AD
Step 5: This simplifies to 55 = yy = pay" (cancel factor 2)
Step 6: In AABD and APQM, all three pairs of corresponding sides are in proportion.
Step 7: Therefore, AABD ~ APQM. (SSS similarity)
Step 8: Part (ii):
Step 9: From the similarity in part (i), we know that corresponding angles are equal. So, ZB = ZQ.
AB BC
Step 10: In AABC and APQR, we are given Fo = on
Step 11: We have two pairs of sides in proportion and the included angles (ZB, ZQ) are equal.
Step 12: Therefore, AABC ~ APQR. (SAS similarity)
Answer: (i) AABD ~ APQM. (ii) AABC ~ APQR.
Question 3
Question: Find x given two triangles ABC and DEF with ZB = ZE, and side data AB=7.5, BC=9,
AC=6; DE=x+3, EF=12, DF=8. (Assuming DF=8, not 9, for consistency).
Solution Given: 7B = ZE and side lengths for AABC and ADEF.
To Prove: Find the value of x.
