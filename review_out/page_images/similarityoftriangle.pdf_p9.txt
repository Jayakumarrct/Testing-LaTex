Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 8

1. Similar right triangles from equal sun elevation: Teeteg = z
2. Tree height = 9 - zo =9-1.25=11.25m.

Equal sun angle gives AAA. Compare heights to shadows directly.
Type F: Coordinate check for similarity
Points: A(0,0), B(4, 2), C(1, 3) and A’(0,0), B’(6, 3), C’(1.5, 4.5). Show AABC ~ AA’B’C’.
Steps
1. Slopes show equal angles: maz = ; = 3 and marr = 2 = a similarly for other sides.
2. Side ratios: AB = V(4)? + (2)? = V20, A’B’ = ¥(6)? + 3)? = V45, ratio = 45/20 = 3.

” [.5)2 + (45)2
3. Likewise ate = v5)? + G5)" = 3 and for BC.
Ac VP +B?

4. Hence k = 3 and triangles are similar (SSS).

Check any two: either AAA via slopes/angles or SSS via distances.
