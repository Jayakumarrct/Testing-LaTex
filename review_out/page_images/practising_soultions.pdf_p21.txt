Step 1: Part (i):
Step 2: In AABC, BP is the bisector of angle ZB.
Step 3: By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the other
two sides.
CB CP woe A
Step 4: Therefore, 55 = Fy. This is equivalent to CB:BA = CP:PA.
Step 5: Part (ii):
Step 6: Let ZACB = y. Then the given condition is ZABC = 2y.
Step 7: Since BP bisects ZABC, we have ZABP = ZPBC = y.
Step 8: Now consider ABPC. We have ZPBC = y and ZPCB = y.
Step 9: Since two angles are equal, ABPC is an isosceles triangle with BP = PC.
Step 10: Now consider AABC and AAPB.
Step ll: ZBAC = ZPAB (Common Angle A).
Step 12: ZACB = y and ZABP = y. So, ZACB = ZABP.
Step 13: Therefore, AABC ~ AAPB. (AA similarity)
AB BC _ AC
14: The ratio of corresponding sides is —> = = = ——,
Step he ratio of corresponding sides is AP PB AB
BC AC .
Step 15: From 55 = Pp, we cross-multiply to get AB- BC = PB- AC.
Step 16: Note: The question has BP - CA, which is the same.
Answer: Both parts are proved.
