Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 6
Worked Examples
Type A: Find an unknown side using similarity
In AABC, DE || BC with D on AB and E on AC. If AD = 6, AB = 9, and AE = 8, find AC.
c
A » 8B

Steps
1. DE || BC > AADE ~ AABC.

AD AE 6 8
2, = =— > -=—.

AB AC 9 AC
3. Cross-multiply: 6 AC = 9-8 = 72.
4. AC = 12.

Use BPT: a single proportion solves it.
Type B: Perimeter and area comparisons
Two similar triangles have side ratio k = = If the smaller has perimeter 24 and area 54, find the
larger’s perimeter and area.
Steps
1. Perimeter scales by k: Piarge = k 24 = > +24 = 40.

> > 5\)*.,_ 25

2. Area scales by k*: Alarge = k“ - 54 = 3 54= roa 54 = 150.

Perimeter xk, area Xk?. Keep which triangle is larger consistent.
Type C: Angle-bisector splits a side
In AABC, AD bisects ZA. If AB = 7, AC = 9, and BC = 12, find BD and DC.
