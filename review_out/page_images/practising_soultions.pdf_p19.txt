Step 11: From AB © DF and BC + DE, vertex B must correspond to vertex D.
Step 12: From BC + DE and AC © FE, vertex C must correspond to vertex E.
Step 13: This leaves vertex A corresponding to vertex F.
Step 14: Therefore, the correct similarity statement is AABC ~ AF DE.
Answer: The triangles are similar by SSS. The correct correspondence is AABC ~ AFDE.
Question 6
Question: In trapezium ABCD with AB || DC, diagonals intersect at P. Prove (i) AAPB ~ ACPD;
(ii) PA- PD = PB- PC.
Solution Given: Trapezium ABCD with AB || DC, diagonals AC and BD intersect at P.
To Prove: (i) AAPB ~ ACPD; (ii) PA: PD = PB: PC.
A B
D Cc
Step 1: Part (i): Consider AAPB and ACPD.
Step 2: Since AB || DC, ZPAB = ZPCD. (alternate interior angles)
Step 3: Similarly, ZPBA = ZPDC. (alternate interior angles)
Step 4: Also, ZAPB = ZCPD. (vertically opposite angles)
Step 5: Therefore, AAPB ~ ACPD. (AAA similarity)
Step 6: Part (ii): From the similarity proved in part (i), the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.
PA PB AB
Step” BG = pp > CD
. : PA PB
Step 8: Taking the first two parts of the proportion: PC PD
Step 9: Cross-multiply to get PA- PD = PB- PC. (algebra)
Answer: (i) The triangles are similar. (i) The product equality is proved.

Solution Given: Parallelogram ABCD, P on BC, L is the intersection of extended DP and extended
AB.
DPD DL AL
To Prove: (i) —— = Be. (i) — = —.
