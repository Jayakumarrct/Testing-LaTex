Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 3
Consequences of Similarity
If AABC ~ AA’B’C’ with scale factor k (so A’B’ = k AB), then:
* Corresponding angles are equal.
o AY _ Be AH
A'B’ BIC’ C/A ik
+ Perimeter ratio is Pasi =k.
Pasc
* Area ratio is (AVC) KR,
[ABC]
+ Altitudes, medians, and angle bisectors scale by k.
A 0 Ao q AB hap .
A quick proof (altitudes scale by k): In similar triangles, We because both pairs
‘A'B!
are opposite equal angles and form similar right triangles when dropping perpendiculars. Hence
Dip = hap.

A
Area shortcut: If sides scale by k, areas scale by k?. If perimeters scale by 3, areas scale by 9.
