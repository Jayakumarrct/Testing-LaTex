Step 5: (v) True. An isosceles right triangle must have angles 90-45-45. Any two such triangles are similar

by AAA similarity.
Step 6: (vi) True. In a trapezium ABCD with AB || DC, the diagonals intersect at O, forming AAOB and

ACOD. These triangles are similar (AA similarity), so their sides are proportional: AG = $2.
Answer: (i) False, (ii) True, (iii) True, (iv) False, (v) True, (vi) True.
Question 12
Question: D is a point on the side BC of triangle ABC such that ZADC = ZBAC. Prove that
CA? =CB-CD.
Solution Given: In AABC, D is on BC such that ZADC = ZBAC.
To Prove: AC? = CB-CD.

A
B D c

Step 1: Consider AADC and ABAC.
Step 2: ZADC = ZBAC. (given)
Step 3: ZACD = ZBCA (or ZC). (common angle)
Step 4: Therefore, AADC ~ ABAC. (AA similarity)
Step 5: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal. Match vertices: A B, DG A,C oC.

_ AC DC AD .
Step 6: 80, BG = 4G = Ba: (corresponding sides)

_ AC DC
Step 7: From the first two parts of the proportion, BO- AC:
Step 8: Cross-multiply to get AC x AC = BC x DC, which is AC? = CB-CD. (algebra)
Answer: AC? = CB-CD.
Question 13
Question: AABC and AAMP are right-angled at B and M respectively. A is a common vertex. AC =
10 cm, AP = 15 cm, PM = 12 cm. (i) Prove AABC ~ AAMP. (ii) Find AB and BC.
Solution Given: 2B = 2M = 90Â°, A is a common vertex. AC=10, AP=15, PM=12.
To Prove: (i) similarity; (ii) find AB, BC.
