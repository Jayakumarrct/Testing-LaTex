Exercise 15A Solutions
Question 2
Question: In triangles ABC and DEF, 2A = ZD and 42 = 4G. Prove that AABC ~ ADEF.
Solution Given: ZA = ZD and 43 = AC.
— DE DF
To Prove: AABC ~ ADEF (SAS).
c F
L B L\
E
A D
Step 1: Identify the included angle and sides: in AABC, sides AB, AC include ZA; in ADEF, sides
DE, DF include ZD. (definition of included angle)
AB AC ;
Step 2: Use the data 2A = 2D and T= Fp. (given)
Step 3: Conclude AABC ~ ADEF. (SAS similarity)
Answer: AABC ~ ADEF by SAS.
Question 3
Question: In AABC and ADEF, ZA = ZD, ZB = ZE and ZC = ZF. Also, AL and DM are medians.
Prove that 35 = #4.
Solution Given: AABC ~ ADEF (AAA), and AL, DM are medians.
To Prove: BC AL
HORTON: EF DM"
B E
A D
BC AB_A ;
Step 1: From AABC ~ ADEF, get oc =n a“ (similar triangles)
Step 2: Since L and M are midpoints, BL = 5 BC and EM = 3 EF. (definition of median)
BL BC

Step 3: Therefore 77 = FR (divide equal halves)
Step 4: In AABL and ADEM, we have ZB = ZE and 22, = BE (correspondence from similarit

ep 4: In an we have ZB = ZE and 555 = gqq- (correspondence from similarity)
