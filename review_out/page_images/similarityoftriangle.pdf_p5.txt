Similarity of Triangles — Quick Notes (Grade 10) 4
Key Theorems from Similarity
Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales): If a line through a triangle is parallel to one side, it
divides the other two sides proportionally.
If DE || BC in AABC, the AD _ AE id AD _AE
II BC in 2ABC. then Te = 5G 4 AB AC
Cc
D B
A
Proof idea: Since DE || BC, ADE = ZABC and AED = ZACB (alternate interior angles).
AD AE DE _AD_ AE AD AE
Thus AADE ~ AABC (AAA), so —— = —= and —— = —— = —. From the first, —— = —.
AB AC BC AB AC DB EC
Converse of BPT: If a line through a triangle cuts two sides proportionally, it is parallel to the
third side.

Angle Bisector Theorem (internal): In AABC, if AD bisects ZA with D on BC, then Yel = AC
. 5 9 ‘ BE AB
External bisector at A meets the extension of BC at E and gives ECAC

Right-triangle similarity facts:
* Inright AABC with right angle at C, altitude from C to hypotenuse AB meets AB at H. Then
AACH ~ AABC ~ AHCB.
* Mean proportionals: CH? = AH - HB, AC? = AH - AB, BC? = HB- AB.
+ Pythagoras by similarity: From AC? = AH - AB and BC? = HB- AB, add to get AC? + BC? =
