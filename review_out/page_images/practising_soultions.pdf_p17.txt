Step 1: For the triangles to be similar by SAS, the sides including the equal angles must be proportional.
Step 2: The sides including ZB are AB and BC. The sides including ZE are DE and EF.
. _ AB _ BC ;
Step 3: Set up the proportion: 7 = F-.. (SAS similarity condition)
Step 4: Substitute the given values; 7. = =. (substitution)

it : Solve the equation —— = -.
Step 6: Solve the equation 374
Step 7: Cross-multiply: 7.5 x 4 = 3x (« +3). (algebra)
Step 8: 30=32+9 = 384=21 = x=7.
. . : woe AC 6 34.
Step 9: Consistency Check: Let's check the ratio of the third sides, AC and DF. T= = 5 = 5. Since
this ratio is the same, the triangles are indeed similar by SSS.
Answer: x = 7.
Question 4
Question: In the given figure, BC —— DE. Find the lengths of the sides of both the triangles. Sides are
given as expressions in x. AADE: AD=18, AE=6x, DE=3(x+1). AABC: AB=2x-+1, AC=4x, BC=?.
Solution Given: A is the top vertex, DE is a horizontal line below BC, and BC || DE. Side lengths in
terms of x.
To Prove: Find the value of x and the lengths of all sides.
A

D E
Step 1: Since BC | DE, by the property of similar triangles, AABC ~ AADE. (AA similarity)
Step 2: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal: 22 — AC _ BC
ep 2: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal: 775 = 5 = pay
