Step 1: In AAOB and ACOD, ZOAB = ZOCD and ZOBA=ZODC. (alternate interior angles,

AB || DC)
Step 2: Also, ZAOB = ZCOD. (vertically opposite angles)
Step 3: Hence AAOB ~ ACOD. (AAA similarity)

OA _ OB .

Step 4: Therefore Ga = Gy: 80 OA-OD = OB-OC. (corresponding sides)
Step 5: The given numerics (BO = 6, DQ = 8) do not determine BP-DO without additional relationships

between P,@ and the diagonals.
Answer: AAOB ~ ACOD and OA-OD = OB- OC. The product BP - DO cannot be found from the
given data alone.
Question 4
Question: In AABC, BM 1 AC and CN 1 AB; show that 48 = 8Y = 44.
Solution Given: In AABC, BM 1 AC and CN 1 AB.
To Prove: 22 — BM _ AM
———= AC CN AN”

A
Step 1: Consider AAMB and AANC.
Step 2: ZAMB = 90° and ZANC = 90°. (given, BM 1 AC,CN 1 AB)
Step 3: ZMAB = ZNAC (or ZA). (common angle)
Step 4: Therefore, AAMB ~ AANC. (AA similarity)
AB_ BM _ AM

Step 5: The ratio of corresponding sides must be equal: 37 = Gyr = Gar (cormesponding sides of

similar triangles)
Answer: The relationship is proved.
