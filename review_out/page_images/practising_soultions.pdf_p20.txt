Step 1: Part (i): Consider ADPC and ALPB.
Step 2: Since AL is an extension of AB, and AB || DC, we have AL || DC.
Step 3: ZPDC = ZPLB (or ZPLA). (alternate interior angles)
Step 4: ZPCD = ZPBL. (alternate interior angles, since AD || BC)
Step 5: Therefore, ADPC ~ ALPB. (AA similarity)
: . . . DP PC DC
Step 6: The ratio of corresponding sides is 55 = Be = FR:
. . : DP DC
Step 7: From this, we get the required relation: => = >
PL BL
Step 8: Part (i): Start with the result from part (i): 55 = Fo (inverting the ratio)
: PL BL
Step 9: Add 1 to both sides: 5 +1= GG +1. (algebra)
PL+DP BL+DC
10: bine terms: ——— = <7
Step 10: Combine terms: DP DG
Step 11: Since D, P, L are collinear, PL + DP = DL.
Step 12: Since A, B, L are collinear, BL + AB = AL. Also, AB = DC in a parallelogram.
cs . _ DL BL+AB_ AL
Step 13: Substitute these into the equation: 5G = —Ba— = po
Answer: Both proportions are proved.
Question 8
Question: In AABC, ZABC = 2ZACB. The bisector of ZABC, BP, meets AC at P. Show: (i) CB:BA
= CP:PA (ii) AB- BC = BP-CA.
Solution Given: BP bisects ZABC; ZABC = 2ZACB.
To Prove: (i) CB:BA = CP:PA; (ii) AB- BC = BP-CA.
