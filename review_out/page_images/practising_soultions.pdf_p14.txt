Step 1: Let AE: ED = m:n (unknown from the data). Then the line through E parallel to the bases
cuts off a segment EF whose length is the weighted mean of the bases:
pp TAB+mDC
m+n
(similar triangles along the transversals)
Step 2: Without m:n (or AD), neither EC nor EF can be uniquely determined.
Answer: Additional information (e.g., AE : ED) is required. In general, if AE : ED = m:n, then
nAB+mDC
bree.
m+n
Question 16
Question: In AABC, P is a point on AB such that AP:PB = 4:3. PQ is drawn parallel to AC to meet
BC at Q. (i) Find the ratio PQ:AC. (ii) If a line from A is perpendicular to CD (where D is on BC) at R
and PQ is perpendicular to CD at $, and QS = 6 em, find AR.
AP 4
Solution Given: 57 = 5 and PQ || AC.
To Prove: (i) PQ:AC; (ii) AR given QS=6.

B
Step 1: Part (i): Consider ABPQ and ABAC.
Step 2: Since PQ || AC, ZBPQ = ZBAC and ZBQP = ZBCA. (corresponding angles)
Step 3: ZB is common to both triangles.
Step 4: Therefore, ABPQ ~ ABAC. (AAA similarity)
. . _ , . BP BQ_ PQ
Step 5: The ratio of comesponding sides is 55 = FG = Fee
BP 3k 3
tep 6: Given AP: PB =4:3, so AB = AP + PB =4k+3k =k. Thus —— = =,
Step 6: Given 3, so + + ns Ba = ET
Step 7: Hence, PQ: AC =3:7.
Step 8: Part (ii): Consider ABQS and ABCR.
Step 9: ZBSQ = ZBRC = 90° (assuming $ is on BQ, R on BC).
Step 10: ZQBS = ZCBR (common angle B).
Step 11: So ABQS ~ ABCR.
