2. In triangles ABC and DEF, ZA = ZD and
AB DE
—— =—., then prove that AABC ~ ADEF.
AC DF P A B Q
2. AA or AAA similarity : If two triangles have atleast two pairs of corresponding
angles equal; the triangles are similar. (AA or AAA postulate)
Example :
If in A ABC and A DEF, ZA = ZD and ZB = ZE, A ABC ~ A DEF.
=e - A
Since, the sum of the angles of a triangle is D
180°, therefore if two angles of one triangle are
equal to two angles of another triangle each to
each, their third angles are also equal.
