## üîë SIMILARITY CRITERIA

### AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle)
**Theorem:** If three angles of one triangle equal three angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar.

**Conditions:** ‚à†A = ‚à†X, ‚à†B = ‚à†Y, ‚à†C = ‚à†Z
**Result:** ‚ñ≥ABC ‚àº ‚ñ≥XYZ
**Consequence:** All corresponding sides are proportional.

### SAS (Side-Angle-Side)
**Theorem:** If two sides are proportional and included angle equal, triangles are similar.

**Conditions:** AB/XY = AC/XZ and ‚à†A = ‚à†X
**Result:** ‚ñ≥ABC ‚àº ‚ñ≥XYZ
**Proportionality:** AB/XY = BC/YZ = CA/ZX

### SSS (Side-Side-Side)
**Theorem:** If three sides are proportional, triangles are similar.

**Conditions:** AB/XY = BC/YZ = CA/ZX
**Result:** ‚ñ≥ABC ‚àº ‚ñ≥XYZ
**Consequence:** All corresponding angles are equal.

## üìê KEY THEOREMS

### Angle Bisector Theorem
**Theorem:** Angle bisector divides opposite side in ratio of other two sides.

**Statement:** In ‚ñ≥ABC, if AD bisects ‚à†BAC, then: AB/AC = BD/DC

**Extended:** For angle bisector from vertex B: AC/BC = AB/BD = AP/PD

### Midpoint Theorem
**Theorem:** Line joining midpoints is parallel to third side and half its length.

**Statement:** If M midpoint AB, N midpoint AC, then MN ‚à• BC and MN = ¬ΩBC

### Geometric Mean Theorems (Right Triangles)
**Theorem:** In right ‚ñ≥ABC (‚à†C=90¬∞), CD‚ä•AB, then:
1. CD¬≤ = AD √ó DB
2. AC¬≤ = AD √ó AB
3. BC¬≤ = DB √ó AB

### Trapezium Properties
**Theorem:** In trapezium ABCD (AB‚à•CD), diagonals intersect at O:

1. ‚ñ≥AOB ‚àº ‚ñ≥COD
2. AO/CO = BO/DO or AO√óOD = BO√óOC

## üßÆ ESSENTIAL FORMULAS

### Basic Proportionality
**Similar Triangles Ratio:** ‚ñ≥ABC ‚àº ‚ñ≥XYZ ‚Üí AB/XY = BC/YZ = CA/ZX = k

**Area Ratio:** Area(‚ñ≥ABC)/Area(‚ñ≥XYZ) = k¬≤

**Perimeter Ratio:** Perimeter(‚ñ≥ABC)/Perimeter(‚ñ≥XYZ) = k

### Median Properties
**Median Length:** In ‚ñ≥ABC, median AM to BC: AM/BM = AM/MC = ‚Öî

**Centroid Division:** Medians intersect at G where AG:GD = 2:1

### Angle Relationships
**Isosceles Triangle:** If AB = AC, then ‚à†B = ‚à†C

**Exterior Angle:** ‚à†ACD = ‚à†ABC + ‚à†BAC

**Parallel Lines:** If AB ‚à• CD, then:
- Alternate interior angles equal
- Corresponding angles equal
- Consecutive interior angles supplementary

## üõ† PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Read carefully:** Identify given info and what to prove
2. **Draw diagram:** Sketch figure with all given information
3. **Identify similarity:** Look for parallel lines, equal angles, proportional sides
4. **Apply theorems:** Use appropriate similarity criteria (AAA, SAS, SSS)
5. **Set up proportions:** Write ratios of corresponding sides
6. **Solve:** Cross-multiply and solve for unknowns
7. **Verify:** Check if all conditions satisfied

### Common Problem Types

#### Parallel Lines Problems
**Strategy:** When parallel lines cut transversals, corresponding angles equal.

**Example:** If DE ‚à• BC and AD, AE are transversals:
‚ñ≥ADE ‚àº ‚ñ≥ABC ‚Üí AD/AB = AE/AC = DE/BC

#### Angle Bisector Problems
**Strategy:** Use Angle Bisector Theorem directly.

**Example:** If BD bisects ‚à†ABC: AB/AC = BD/DC

#### Median Problems
**Strategy:** Midpoints create parallel segments.

**Example:** If D,E midpoints of AB,AC: DE ‚à• BC and DE = ¬ΩBC

#### Right Triangle Problems
**Strategy:** Use Pythagorean theorem and geometric mean.

**Example:** In right ‚ñ≥ABC (‚à†C=90¬∞), CD‚ä•AB: CD¬≤ = AD√óDB

## ‚ö° QUICK CHECKLIST

### For Similarity Problems
- [ ] Are there parallel lines? (‚Üí AAA)
- [ ] Are there equal angles with proportional sides? (‚Üí SAS)
- [ ] Are all sides proportional? (‚Üí SSS)
- [ ] Are there transversals to parallels? (‚Üí Proportional segments)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't assume triangles are congruent when they're only similar
- Check that corresponding vertices match when writing similarity
- Remember that similarity preserves angles but not sizes
- Area ratios are squares of side ratios
- Perimeter ratios equal side ratios

5. **Cross-multiply carefully** and check your algebra
6. **Verify answers** by substituting back into original equations
