# Proofs Report for Sections 3–6

## Section 3
- Theorem: Existence and uniqueness — proof provided.
- Theorem: Every $F$ has an algebraic closure, unique up to $F$-isomorphism — proof provided.
- Proposition: Separability preview — proof provided.

## Section 4
- Proposition (\label{prop:permute-roots}): If $E$ contains a splitting field of $f\in F[x]$, then each $\sigma\in\Aut_F(E)$ permutes the roots of $f$ — proof provided.
- Theorem (\label{thm:autobound}): For any finite extension $E/F$, $\#\Aut_F(E)\le [E\!:\!F]$, with equality iff $E/F$ is Galois — proof provided.

## Section 5
- Proposition [Multiplicity]: In a splitting field, a root $\alpha$ has multiplicity $>1$ iff $f(\alpha)=f'(\alpha)=0$ — proof provided.
- Theorem [Separability criteria] (\label{thm:sep-criteria}): Equivalent conditions for irreducible $f\in F[x]$ — proof provided.
- Corollary [Perfect fields]: If $\operatorname{char}F=0$ or $F$ is finite then every algebraic extension of $F$ is separable — proof provided.
