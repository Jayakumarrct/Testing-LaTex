# Galois Theory Notes

## Build
- Recommended: `latexmk -pdf main.tex`
- Or: `pdflatex main.tex` (run twice for TOC)

## Structure
- `main.tex` includes all section files from `sections/`.
- Put images in `figures/` and include with `\includegraphics{filename}`.
- Start writing inside each `sections/*.tex`.
